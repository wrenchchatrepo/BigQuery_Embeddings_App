# Development Plan for Zendesk Ticket Embedding Project

## Current State Analysis

The project currently consists of several key components:
- Local LLM integration via LM Studio and ngrok for embedding generation
- BigQuery integration for data storage and similarity searches
- Cloud Functions for on-demand embedding generation
- Batch processing capabilities for ticket embedding updates
- Similarity search implementation using cosine similarity

## Development Goals

### 1. Infrastructure Optimization (Week 1-2)
- [ ] Implement robust error handling for ngrok tunnel disconnections
- [ ] Add health check endpoints to monitor LM Studio availability
- [ ] Create automated recovery procedures for connection failures
- [ ] Implement connection pooling for BigQuery operations
- [ ] Add logging and monitoring for all critical operations

### 2. Performance Enhancements (Week 3-4)
- [ ] Implement batch processing optimizations for large datasets
- [ ] Add caching layer for frequently accessed embeddings

- [ ] Implement parallel processing for embedding generation
- [ ] Add rate limiting and request queuing for the embedding service

### 3. Feature Additions (Week 5-6)
- [ ] Implement embedding model versioning and migration tools
- [ ] Add support for multiple embedding models
- [ ] Create A/B testing framework for embedding quality comparison
- [ ] Implement automated embedding quality assessment
- [ ] Add support for incremental updates to embeddings

### 4. User Interface and API Improvements (Week 7-8)
- [ ] Create API documentation using OpenAPI/Swagger
- [ ] Implement API versioning
- [ ] Add request validation and sanitization
- [ ] Implement rate limiting and authentication
- [ ] Create monitoring dashboard for system health

### 5. Testing and Documentation (Week 9-10)
- [ ] Implement comprehensive unit tests
- [ ] Add integration tests for all components
- [ ] Create load testing suite
- [ ] Update technical documentation
- [ ] Create deployment and maintenance guides
